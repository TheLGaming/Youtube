   <h2>Sharks like the great white like cold temperatures and usualy live in areas like Santa Cruz and San Fransisco. But more tropical sharks like the tiger shark like warmer temperatures and life near miami and near or in the Caribbean.</h2>
   <h2>Also, when sharks "taste" people its not because they hate humans, its because they think you are a seal and go to take a sample to see for sure. So you won't really be eaten alive you might just lose most of your leg. How great right...</h2>
